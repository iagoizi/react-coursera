# Ristorante con Fusion

## Project's description

This is a project created to practice technical skills as one of the assignments of **Front-End Web Development with React** course by **The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology**. The main goal is to learn more about git, JavaScript, React, and Redux. With that in mind, the styling isn't important for now, therefore ReactStrap was used.

The project is a website for a restaurant.

## Environment and tools

- npm version: 7.20.3
- React version: 17.0.2
- Redux version:3.7.2
- ReactStrap: 8.9.0

## Steps to run and debug

In this project's root folder, install all the required dependencies by running:

After that, you can run the project by running:
